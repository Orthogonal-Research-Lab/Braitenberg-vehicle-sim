# Braitenberg-vehicle-sim
Basic simulations of braitenberg vehicles

------------------------
## Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* Opencv 4.0.0

-----------------------
To do :-
+ [X] Create a Field class to generate a force fieldin 2D space from a given set of sources and order of decay
+ [X] Create a Vehicle class that is a super class of all types of vehicles
+ [X] Create Vehicle type 1 simulation
+ [ ] Create Vehicle type 2 simulations, just one source
+ [ ] Create Vehicle type 3 simulations, just one source
